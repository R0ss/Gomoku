Rules: Two players alternate in placing a stone of their color onto an empty grid cell. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Twist: In this version, the game will warn players who are about to make a fatal mistake, so that it is no longer sufficient for the opponent to lose - you must win! It might seem odd that the game is preventing players from losing; however, the level of strategy increases dramatically as a result. Ideally, you'd want to win by forcing your opponent into "checkmate", rather than sneaking a 5-in-a-row past them. You can "checkmate" your opponent by producing multiple win conditions that cannot be blocked in one turn. This requires planning ahead and biding your time.
